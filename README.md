# Chip 8 Emulator Swift Package

A Chip-8 emulator Swift package. For use in macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS projects.

This package implements the core functionality of a Chip-8 emulator in Swift. It contains no platform UI elements and this is left to a consumer projects to implement.

## Design
The emulator package contains a `Chip8Engine` which drives the Chip-8 run loop. 

The consumer can:
### Start the engine
`chip8Engine.start()`

### Stop the engine
`chip8Engine.stop()`

### Feed inputs into the engine
[chip-8 keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Input) (`Chip8InputCode`)
- `chip8Engine.handleKeyDown(key: key)`
- `chip8Engine.handleKeyUp(key: key)`

### Receive callbacks from the engine
The callbacks are handled through the delegate pattern. Set the delegate of the engine:

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  chip8Engine.delegate = self
}
```

#### Rendering
The engine will call the delegate `render` method when the engine determines that a render of the pixels is necessary. 

This will only be called when the pixels have changed. The engine assumes that pixels have been rendered on a call to the delegate and will not re-call with the same pixels.

Implement the rendering method:

```
extension YourViewController: Chip8EngineDelegate {
  func render(screen: Chip8Screen) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Beeping
The engine will call the delegate `beep` method when the engine determines that a sound effect needs to be played.

Implement the beep method using the provided `BeepPlayer` (or through a custom implementation):

```
extension YourViewController: Chip8EngineDelegate {
  func beep() {
    beepPlayer.play()
    // haptics etc.
  }
}
```
